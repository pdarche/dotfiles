# Pete's Dotfiles
 - This is the very beginning of a collection of dotfiles. 
 - It's currently just a port of my current setup into a repo with symlinks! __Don't try to use it. It will break things!__ 

## Todo
[x] Port current bash_profile, vimrc, vim plugins, git config 
[x] Create install script to read in the config files and create symlinks
[] Add osx defaults
[] Add package installs for new machines setup
[] Add tmux config 
[] Add to aliases
